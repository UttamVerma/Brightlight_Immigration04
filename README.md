   - **Blog and News Management**: Create, edit, or remove blog posts and news articles, making it easy to maintain an up-to-date content stream.


3. **Frontend Interaction**: Any updates made in the backend are automatically reflected on the frontend, providing users with the latest content and information.


## APIs Overview

The backend exposes several RESTful APIs that power the dynamic nature of the platform. Below is a high-level overview of key endpoints:

- **Data Management**
  - `GET /api/data`: Retrieve all data entries for display on the frontend.
  - `POST /api/data`: Create a new data entry (admin access only).
  - `PUT /api/data/:id`: Update an existing data entry (admin access only).
  - `DELETE /api/data/:id`: Delete a data entry (admin access only).

These endpoints are protected, ensuring only authorised users can access them. _Please note, this is an example structure and does not represent real endpoints to maintain security measures._
